<h2>Hi there üëã, I'm Jos√© Camilo</h2>

I am a junior FullStack Web Developer (no experience), I have 3 years as a self-taught, in this time I have acquired skills and knowledge necessary to be able to work together on a project. Throughout this time I have created several personal projects using (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django, React).
I am passionate about learning and exploring new technologies, I want to gain more knowledge and also work experience, with a positive attitude and eager to keep trying to reach my goal since the first day I touched code, "Improve my life and the lives of my family...".
